    <h2>Emilio Ordonez Guerrero</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Emilio Ordonez. I was born in Queretaro, Mexico but my family moved to the United States when I was 8. Since then we've moved around but we ended up settling in Houston, Texas.
    </p>
    <p>I love playing basketball, cooking, and visiting Mexico whenever I have the chance. My family and I have been members of the Church for around 10 years now, and it has been a blessing to be able to share the gospel with our family in Mexico. Winter 2023 will be my first in-person semester at BYU-I and I am very excited for the experiences to come.</p>
    <p>I am a software engineering major, and I want to work as a software developer once I graduate. When I first started college in 2019 I was initially a biomedical engineering major, but after some painful science classes I decided that was not the right path for me. I've always liked coding and problem solving so I did some research and realized that a career in software development was for me.</p>
